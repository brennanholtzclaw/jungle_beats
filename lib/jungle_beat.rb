# pseudo code through this linked list.
# do you need a node class and a list class?
# if done recursively, are both still needed?
  # Initial thoughts I didn't think so, now I think I'll need at least a node
    # class, but maybe not neccessarily a list class.
# Perhaps the junglebeat class takes in the string, and parses it out into
# the appropriate number of nodes, assigning data appropriatly
# from there you should ("should?") be able to call all methods recursively.
# Even though you're calling the method on the junglebeat object, it would pass
# it recursively to each node.

# Horace of course thinks 3 classes would be neccessary - I got a plausible
# when I threw out my two class idea...


# JB new should take the passed in data and create a new node for each word
# the first node created should be designated the head.
# The last node created should be designated the tail - THIS MAY BE OPTIONAL
